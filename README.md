The objective of this project is to identify and classify different alphabets and numbers of ISL in real time. Different Sign Languages are used in different parts of the world which is obvious due to cultural and linguistic differences. This project is completely focused on the recognition of Indian Sign Language(ISL). ISL does not have standard signs for different words unlike American Sign Language(ASL) which is same throughout the whole country. Multiple signs can have same meaning in ISL which makes it even harder to recognize it using Machine or Deep Learning models. There has been a lot of research that has been done for the recognition of ASL, but a few published research works are available for ISL. Its primarily due to the lack of standard datasets. According to the National Association of Deaf (NAD), 18 Million people are estimated to be deaf in India which is a huge number, therefore it is essential that now that the technology has advanced so much, some effective and cheap solutions exist in the market to help this community. This project will not only make it easier for deaf and mute people to communicate with anyone, but it will also help people to learn sign language faster.
